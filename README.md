# todolist
I made a really samrt todolist while i was learning more about back-end.


## its smart!
- A main todolist page which is the main route.
- When you check a task, it goes automatically to `/archive` page. And of course you can uncheck it from there and it will get back to its own list (either its main(`/` home route) or other lists you made).
- you can make unlimited lists just go to `/nameOfTheList`



_I made this for fun and i keep updating it when I wanna have fun on a free time so more updates coming hopefully._
